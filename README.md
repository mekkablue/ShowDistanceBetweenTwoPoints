# ShowDistanceBetweenTwoPoints.glyphsReporter

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/) by Georg Seifert.
It displays the distance between two selected nodes when exactly two points are selected, ignoring intersections in between.
After installation, it will add the menu item *View > Show Distance between Two Points* (German: *Abstand zwischen zwei Punkten anzeigen*, French: *Afficher distance entre deux points*).
You can set a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences.

### Installation

1. Download the complete ZIP file and unpack it, or clone the repository.
2. Double click the .glyphsReporter file. Confirm the dialog that appears in Glyphs.
3. Restart Glyphs.

### Usage Instructions

1. Open a glyph in Edit view.
2. Use *View > Show Distance between Two Points*.
3. Select exactly two points (on-curve or off-curve).

### Requirements

The plugin needs Glyphs 2.3 or higher, running on OS X 10.9.1 or later. I can only test it in current OS versions, and I assume it will not work in prior versions.
